         <h2>Is there anything I can do well?</h2><br>
         <p>It can be hard to build a portfolio when you only just started, but I’ll try to demonstrate that the things that I already do well are going to be relevant on my path to become a web develloper.</p>

            <p>If there’s one thing I believe is going to be important when trying to learn coding, it’s my ability to fail. I’m not kidding. The one reason I can do everything fast on a computer is because I am not afraid to mess everything up. Look something up, make a back-up and go to town. If everything breaks, no biggie, go one step back and try again. And again.</p>

            <p>I can’t say I have a massive experience but I think we can agree I have a knack for it. Now maybe teaching does not seem relevant to a work environment but teaching is communicating. You need to be able to figure out what your student understand before you can start to share your knowledge. Being able to figure out what anyone’s grasp on something is, well, that's important anytime you need to work as a team.</p>
