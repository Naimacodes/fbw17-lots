         <h2>Where in the world is Virgile Sandiego?</h2><br>
         <p>“Where are you from” is one of the first questions you ask anybody you meet isn't it? Well I’m from a small harbour town in Brittany, France. But maybe more important than where I’m from is where I’ve been. Sure, you usually don’t learn coding on the road, but you still learn a whole bunch of other stuff.</p>

            <p>I went to Ireland for no good reason when I was 20. I just wanted to leave home and see what’s up. I started getting small jobs, first time working in a call centre, first time working at a hostel, that kinda things. And at that time even small jobs paid decently there so I spent a decent amount of time checking out the countryside, and, naturally, an indecent amount of time in pubs.</p>

            <p>After living abroad for the first time, it became pretty clear that I wouldn't stay in my home country for very long from now on. I went to live in Florence, started working in a hostel again, and had a first experience teaching there (more like a French conversation class than actual teaching). It’s also where I drank mate with Argentinian tourists for the first time, which would become important when deciding where to go next.</p>

            <p>On the basis of “sure, why not?” I ended up getting my passport made in Rome in the span of two weeks and moved to Morocco. I learned the importance of hot drinks for social acceptance as pouring and drinking mint tea correctly is probably the number one factor on how to make friends in Marrakesh. I also taught for the second time, reading book to school children in a remote village of the Atlas (I made weird impulse decisions at that time).</p>

            <p>By then I had to put my theory on the importance of hot drinks to the test so, since I was already introduced to mate, Argentina was naturally my next destination. I spent most of three years between Buenos Aires and Santiago de Chile, again working in hostels, again teaching kids for some random reason, and I was even told by an Uruguayan gaucho that I’m a natural at riding horses (this is a big deal, the test was asking me to roll a cigarette on horseback on my first day).</p>

            <p>And here I am, the one good reason I had to move to Germany was that before then I traveled on short 8 month bursts, always having to go back to my mom and work in France before moving on again, and I figured I could just stay in Germany without having to go back. After almost five years I’m starting to ask myself if I could find a job more sustainable than making beds and delivering pizzas. Let’s find out!</p>
